To run the project : 
     **npm start**



My House Terminal is a project that centralizes everything I need in order to effectively manage my household stocks, check today's weather and the 7-day forecast, and stay updated with the latest news headlines to see if there is anything important happening currently in France.

This is a project I wanted to share publicly to allow people to use its template to create their own house terminal.

The theme is heavily inspired by Fallout's Terminal. I've attempted to recreate the dark green background and green font color to give it a cozy feel and evoke nostalgia from when I played Fallout, finding their terminal to be super relaxing.

If you're an HR professional or a recruiter, hello! Take a seat, maybe grab a cup of tea.

If you're someone who wants to use my template, feel free to use it as you like. If you want to make significant changes and turn it into a paid subscription website, well, if my work can help someone improve their life, go for it.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope to be considered for the job! (Please? Anyone? Hello?)

PS : 1. the API for the news is a paid one if you deploy the website so maybe try changing it for a free one before 
     2. obvious one but change the mongo cluster/DB/collection to your own, I'll leave the public one for everyone to add whatever they like
     3. change the weather coordinates here : https://open-meteo.com/en/docs , mine is my city's forecast
